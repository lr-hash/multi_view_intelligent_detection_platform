# Gemini Project: 多视域智能侦测平台

This project is a full-stack web application designed to provide an intelligent monitoring and analysis platform for mine safety. It integrates data from multiple sources, provides visualization capabilities, and offers intelligent evaluation of engineering effects.

## Management & Methodology
This project uses the **Conductor** methodology for task organization and execution. All mission-level context, specifications, and implementation plans are stored in the `conductor/` directory.

## Modules

- **backend**: A Flask-based backend application responsible for data processing, analysis, and serving the API.
- **frontend**: A Vue.js-based frontend application for user interaction, data visualization, and dashboarding.
