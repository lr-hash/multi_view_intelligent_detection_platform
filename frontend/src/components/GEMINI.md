# Components Module

This directory contains smaller, reusable Vue components that are used across different views to build the user interface.

## Responsibilities

-   Encapsulate a specific piece of UI and logic (e.g., a custom button, a chart, a data table, a modal dialog).
-   Be self-contained and maintain its own state where appropriate.
-   Receive data from parent components via props and emit events to communicate back up.
-   Promote UI consistency and code reuse throughout the application.

*(This directory is currently empty but will be populated as the UI is built out.)*
