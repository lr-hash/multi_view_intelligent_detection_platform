# Services Module

This module contains the core business logic of the application, separated from the request/response handling of the API layer. Services are responsible for complex calculations, data transformations, and interactions with the database models.

## Responsibilities

-   Implement data validation and cleaning rules.
-   Execute data fusion algorithms.
-   Calculate evaluation metrics and generate reports.
-   Contain any complex queries or business logic that shouldn't live in the API endpoints directly.
